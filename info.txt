Final Project Instructions: AI Project Evaluation Rubric
Project Evaluation Criteria
Refer to the AI Project Evaluation Rubric [PDF Download PDF

]:
The rubric outlines the evaluation categories, including technical implementation, creativity, innovation, presentation, and documentation.
Review each section of the rubric carefully to ensure your project meets the expectations for high scores.
Submission Guidelines
Deliverables:

Project Report:
Submit a comprehensive report in PDF format.
Include the following sections:
Introduction: Brief overview of the problem and your solution.
Methodology: Detailed description of the AI techniques, algorithms, and tools used.
Results: Analysis, visualizations, or metrics demonstrating the project outcomes.
Conclusion: Reflection on the results and potential future improvements.
References: List all resources and citations in a standard format.
Project Files:
Submit all code, datasets (if applicable), and dependencies in a zip file.
Include a clear README file with instructions for running the project, detailing:
Software requirements.
Steps to set up the environment.
Command-line instructions or GUI usage.
File Naming Convention:

Use the format: ProjectTitle.pdf for the report and ProjectTitle.zip for the project files.
Submission Method:

Upload both files to the designated platform before the deadline.
Important Notes ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️:
Ensure the code is functional and thoroughly tested before submission.
Documentation will be a key part of the evaluation. Poorly documented projects will lose marks.
Late submissions are not available at this point or the use of slack days.
